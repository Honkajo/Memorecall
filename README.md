# **_Memorecall_**

With this application user can register and log in into account and create flashcards. User can create separate packs of flashcards with two sides. Memorization of the flashcards is based on Leitner-system where the already learned cards move to the next level so that the cards that are harder to learn are studied more.After the fifth successful recall of the flashcard, card moves to the learned-pile and does not show anymore during learning.
